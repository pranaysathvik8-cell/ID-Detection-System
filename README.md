# ID Detection System

A machine learning-based project designed to detect and process ID card information from images.  
This system applies computer vision techniques for image preprocessing and ID recognition.  
Developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment for experimentation and analysis.

## Features

- Image preprocessing and enhancement  
- ID card detection from input images  
- Structured workflow for processing image data  
- Modular and easy-to-understand notebook implementation  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure

```
id_detection.ipynb    # Main implementation notebook
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

### 3. Run the Project

```
jupyter notebook
```

Open `id_detection.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## Usage

1. Provide an input image containing an ID card.  
2. Execute the notebook cells step by step.  
3. The system processes the image and performs ID detection and analysis.
